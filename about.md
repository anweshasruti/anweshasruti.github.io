Hello! My name is Anwesha Paul, and I am currently a high school student. I have a lot of pretty varied interests, but some things I love especially are linguistics, mathematics, computer science, geography, and sociology. I think this site is mainly going to focus on linguistics for now, along with my very random rants on topics I think are interesting haha. Maybe I'll share some notes here, or post solutions to psets :)

The inspiration for creating this site actually came from my parents, and also from some really cool blogs I follow (and which you should check out too, because they're amazing!):

- [Evan Chen's site](https://web.evanchen.cc/) (his [Napkin book](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf) is love)
- [Sunaina Pati's old blog](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), mainly about maths
- [Aditya Ghosh's legendary handouts and notes](https://ghoshadi.wordpress.com/)
- [Arjun Agarwal's newsletter](https://arjunagarwal.substack.com/), about literally everything

This will probably be very sporadically updated, but I hope to post soon :)
