The inspiration for creating this site actually came from my parents, and also from some really cool blogs I follow (and which you should check out too, because they're amazing!):

- [Evan Chen's site](https://web.evanchen.cc/) (his [Napkin book](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf) is love)
- [Sunaina Pati's old blog](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), mainly about maths
- [Aditya Ghosh's legendary handouts and notes](https://ghoshadi.wordpress.com/)
- [Arjun Agarwal's newsletter](https://arjunagarwal.substack.com/), about literally everything

I also want to mention here [a magazine which I love](https://scream0magazine.blogspot.com/). It is written by students and for students, and its articles are wonderfully thoughtful (and thought-provoking!), brilliantly critical of society, and at the same time beautifully hopeful and aspirational.

## A small history of why I started liking the subjects I do

I used to find maths very boring when I was younger, until I was exposed to the kind that dealt with the manipulation of more abstract objects rather than brute computation by hand (which I am still atrocious at). I eventually transitioned into learning as much as I could about proof-based mathematics, because I found it an extremely elegant subject that, at least at the school level, was sidelined as an instrument rather than being portrayed as the very spirit of mathematics it is. In that respect I think mathematics is a kind of art; an expression of abstraction in the simplest form possible.

I also think that mathematical thinking in general is not lauded enough for the clarity it brings. Breaking down a process into its components and simplifying them were things I only internalised after being exposed to the paradigms of maths and programming, and it kind of annoys me how tasks which are much easier done when some time is taken to simplify their initial conditions or figure out a way to efficiently automate them are tediously done repeatedly by most people.

Generality and keeping one’s eyes open as to the interactions between all these different objects is also a very fun thing^^ This is a pretty silly example, but when I was much younger, and had been asked to define what a point was, I had said, “a circle with radius zero” (and got reprimanded haha). Much later, I learnt what a degenerate case was, and it was pretty satisfying to realise I had indeed said something somewhat right:) Another memory I have is from my tenth-grade geography class (I loved that class), where my teacher had brought up the idea of _ubuntu,_ an African philosophy which may roughly be translated as, _“I am what I am because of who we all are”._ In English, the word _ecosystem,_ which has a more specific meaning in biology but generally indicates the harmony between the different components of a system, originates from the Greek _οἶκος,_ meaning home. I think it’s very fascinating for two cultures seemingly so disparate from one another to have had such a similar idea.

As for linguistics, languages have always been something I have loved, and it was super satisfying to discover the interactions between various linguistic objects and how they compared to each other across languages when I started getting into the subject.

Lastly, I'd like to thank a girl I met years ago, who gave me amazing advice on learning how to think mathematically and solve problems. I don't remember her name, or much else, but that discussion was instrumental in a lot of ways in helping me to grow. So thank you:)
